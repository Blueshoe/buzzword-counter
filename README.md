# buzzword-counter

This repository contains a simple django app to create "Buzzwords" and manipulate their counter via a frontend, that only a true backend-developer might describe as fancy ;)
It accompanies our blog post "Cloud Native Kubernetes Development", available at [Blueshoe (DE)](https://www.blueshoe.de/blog/kubernetes-development/) and [Unikube (EN)](https://unikube.io/blog/how-does-kubernetes-development-work/).
